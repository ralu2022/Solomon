Today, this traditional event of the Scheians is known as "The Descent of the Juniors into the Citadel and the Ascension to the Stones of Solomon" being carried out by the Union of Juniors from the Scheii of Brașov and Brașov Vechi. in partnership with the City Hall of Brașov. 
The day on which this event was set is always the first Sunday after Easter Sunday, known as Tomii Sunday.</dd>
